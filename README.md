# The Next Joe Coffee

This contains my data viz project for APAN5800 Storytelling with Data course at Columbia University.

I conducted sentiment analysis by scrapping data from Yelp to uncover coffee drinker preferences in NYC for Joe Coffee Company to better position their next outlet. Text mining techniques from the tidytext library (in R) were used to uncover consumer sentiments and were visualized using word clouds and network diagrams. Sentiment scores on all coffee shop text reviews were also investigated to explore whether there is correlation between location and high review ratings.
